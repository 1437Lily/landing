                <p> Not even the other spirits claim to understand the mind 
                    and machinations of the eldest amongst them, <span>Inai the 
                    Void Spirit</span>. Privy to secrets that would shatter a mortal 
                    mind, the Void Spirit observes the workings of the universe 
                    from an unknowable vantage, choosing to let carefully groomed
                    servants do his bidding only emerging from his Hidden 
                    Temple into the material plane when he deems that he alone 
                    can steer the course of reality along its proper path.

                    <p>Void Spirit dispatches a remnant to the target location. The remnant stands watch over the region, facing the direction of his vector. When a unit crosses its gaze, the remnant pulls it in and damages it.
                        <span> "Inai exists far beyond the scope of a single point in space and time."</span>

                    <p>Void Spirit temporarily fades into the aether, creating a number of portals through which he can reassemble himself. Upon exiting a portal, he damages all enemies in the area.
                        <span> "Inai much prefers to observe our plane free from the confines of corporeal form."</span>

                    <p>Void Spirit wraps himself in a physical attack damage barrier and 
                        emits a single damaging pulse around him. The barrier gains increased 
                        damage absorption for each enemy hero the pulse hits. The barrier only
                         protects against attacks.
                        <span> "Inai never hesitates to shroud himself in the essence of his 
                            true self when forced to interact with the mortal plane."</span></div>

                    <p>Void Spirit tears a rift through the astral plane to appear at the target
                        location, attacking all enemies along the path. This attack inflicts a
                        void mark that slows for 1.25 seconds and then detonates.
                        <span> "A small step for Inai creates great devastation on the mortal
                             plane."</span></div>

               <p>Inai is the first of the celestials, representing the void.He is known as the 
                Hidden Ones, and resides in the Hidden Temple, only emerging to take part in the
                battle of the Ancients on the mortal plane. Still, he is able to create rips of 
                space in the Astral Plane, which allows him to pass through them and destroy the
                Astral Plane over and over again. He instructs others, such as Lanaya, to do his
                bidding, all while remaining hidden to all but a few.
                Now that he has stepped into the mortal realm, Inai seeks to unite with all the 
                other celestials in an event he calls the Great Confluence.</p>
